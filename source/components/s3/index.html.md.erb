# S3

There are currently 3 buckets used for the Connect project (excluding Terraform).

* nlc-static-prod
* nlc-static-staging
* nlc-concourse-semver

The ``static`` s3 buckets are used to host static file assets like compiled and minified CSS and JS.

S3 bucket configuration is handled by Terragrunt.

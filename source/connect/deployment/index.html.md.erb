# Deployment

There are two ways of deploying the codebase:

1. If there are changes to the helm plan

2. If there are no changes to the helm plan

## With Helm

Diff what's currently there:

`helm diff upgrade prod -n connect nlc-connect -f values-prod.yaml`

Deploy

`helm upgrade prod -n connect nlc-connect -f values-prod.yaml`

## Without Helm

`kubectl -n connect-staging rollout restart deployment staging-nlc-connect`

# Drush

Drush is a command line tool for interacting with Drupal.

You need to be able to ssh into a pod to interact with it:

`kubectl -n connect exec -it prod-nlc-connect-XXXX --container nlc-drupal /bin/bash`

What this command does is execute the bash shell in the `nlc-drupal` container inside a running pod.

You should then have access to a shell where you can run:

`/usr/bin/vaultenv-wrapper vendor/bin/drush`

The `vaultenv-wrapper` ensures that drush has the correct credentials for connecting to the database.
